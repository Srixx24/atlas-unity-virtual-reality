This repository contains many projects from my Fourth trimester of AR/VR development specialization. Within this repository are many projects I worked on strengthing my understanding and skills in developing within Unity in the virtual world. Below are some projects I'm really proud of from this repo.

<center> <h3>Repository Overview</h3> </center>

1. With this project <a href="https://github.com/Srixx24/atlas-unity-virtual-reality/tree/main/360-video">360-video</a> I learn about using render textures to allow a 360 video. I also got my feet wet with VR UI functions and how to implement them. This is a tropical-styled VR experience that really makes you want to head for the closest beach!

2. With this project <a href="https://github.com/Srixx24/atlas-unity-virtual-reality/tree/main/accessibility">accessibility</a> I learned much about gaze functions for the VR world. I took a deeper look into making VR accessible to people with a diverse range of needs, making VR enjoyable and usable for people with various abilities.

3. With this project <a href="https://github.com/Srixx24/atlas-unity-virtual-reality/tree/main/physics-interaction">physics-interaction</a> I learned how to make VR experiences feel more like reality with realistic physics of all kinds of objects. This project is set up like a showroom to provide fun and exciting examples of how the player can interact with objects. From two-handed sword-wielding to a domino effect, this Open Sky Room interaction is a lot of fun. (The banner is an actual screenshot of my game ðŸ¤“)
