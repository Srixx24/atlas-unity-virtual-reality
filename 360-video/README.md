This is a Unity-based virtual reality 360 video that I designed to create a completely immersive VR experience developed for Meta Quest in a Tropical theme. The program comes complete with a VR-friendly user interface, robust video playback system, smooth transitions between videos, four video worlds to view, and a little humor in the UI content. All this together helps the user feel as if they've gone on a mini tropical vacation, with no sunscreen required! I really enjoyed putting this project together and am very proud of the final product I completed in the required week.
